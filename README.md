🏥 OutbreakGuardian – AI-Driven Hospital Optimization Platform

OutbreakGuardian is a hackathon-ready MVP built with Streamlit to showcase how AI can optimize hospital operations during potential outbreaks. The platform integrates early-warning surveillance from multiple data sources (medical records, climate data, social media, and wastewater analysis) with real-time patient flow management, focusing on efficiency, predictive accuracy, and ethical privacy.

🚀 Features
🔐 Login Page

Simple username/password login (simulated, no backend).

📊 Dashboard Home

Key hospital metrics:

Current outbreak risk probability.

Predicted patient inflow.

Resource utilization gauges.

Visualizations with Altair/Matplotlib.

📥 Data Input Page

Upload CSV/JSON files for medical records.

API key fields for external data (climate, social, wastewater).

Data validation and preview tables.

🔮 Prediction & Alerts Page

Simulated AI predictions: outbreak probability, inflow forecasts.

Real-time alerts (high-risk notifications).

Resource allocation suggestions (e.g., ICU bed distribution).

⚖️ Resource Optimization Page

Interactive patient flow simulator with sliders.

Optimized allocations shown in tables & charts.

🔒 Ethics & Settings Page

Privacy and bias-check notes (e.g., federated learning).

Theme toggle (light/dark).

Logout functionality.

🧭 Sidebar Navigation

Persistent sidebar with links to all pages.

User profile & logout.

⚡ Installation & Setup

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/outbreakguardian.git
cd outbreakguardian


Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows


Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the Streamlit app

streamlit run app.py

📊 Dummy Data

The app generates sample data for testing (patient inflow, resource usage, predictions).

You can also upload your own CSV/JSON files for testing the data input module.

⚖️ Ethics & Privacy

Data is anonymized using placeholder federated learning concepts.

Built-in bias check summaries (simulated).

No real patient data is used — demo purposes only.

📌 Hackathon Notes

This is an MVP demo — backend APIs and ML models are simulated placeholders.

Integration points are marked with comments like:
